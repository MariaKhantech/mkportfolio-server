      "description": "Hayden served as my tutor for a while and was a fantastic instructor. He skillfully broke down algorithms, problem-solving techniques, and complex computer science theories. It's always impressive when an engineer can explain things clearly, and Hayden excels at this. I never hesitated to ask him any question, from the simplest to the most intricate. He was even willing to help me with new technologies he hadn't used before, enthusiastically tackling the challenge and aiding me in debugging AI-related problems. Hayden would be an exceptional asset to any team – he demonstrates strong mentorship, leadership, and a friendly personality that makes collaboration enjoyable.",

Maria is not only skilled and knowledgeable, but also supportive and collaborative. She always has her co-workers’ backs and is not afraid to speak up when others are hesitant. She is constantly looking for new ways to enhance the user experience and deliver high-quality products. She is always learning new technologies and sharing her insights with the team. In my opinion Maria would be a great asset to any engineering team.",

      "description": "I worked with Maria for a little over a year and during that time, I was impressed not only by Maria's technical coding abilities but also her eagerness to learn. At the time, she had just completed the TechStart program within Liberty Mutual, and I interviewed her to join my team. Not only was her technical ability superb, but she was able to communicate her thoughts effectively. After that process was complete, she joined my team as an Associate Software Engineer. As a new member of the team and also as a relatively new software engineer in her career, she had a lot of questions. This led into me mentoring her during her first couple months. She is very patient, curious, and has very high standards for the work that she does. For example, while she was learning, she always wanted to understand concepts and ideas fully, and asked lots of questions and she cared deeply about her work and wanted her work to be as high quality as possible, which I really appreciated. Even though it took her a bit longer to complete her work, she always did her work diligently and with very high quality, and as a result very few bugs came out of the features that she built. She is also a very warm hearted person. She took the initiative to organize virtual hangouts with the other engineers to bond, and we all learned something about each other in those hangouts and they were a lot of fun. Overall, Maria is a very talented, curious, and diligent engineer who is also a trustworthy team player and friend. I think any team would be lucky to have her and her future looks very bright.",

      "description": "I met Maria during a period of time when I was leading her squad in Agile practices. As part of that experience I was able to connect with her during regular one-on-one sessions. I’d like to talk about a few of the things I learned about her during our time together.  Maria has a strong aptitude and passion for technology. The career path seems like a natural fit that will satisfy both her curious mind and heart.  She believes in the importance of an empowered team. She is not afraid to use her voice, and works to encourage others to do the same in order to arrive at the best solution through collaborative conversation.  Maria is goal driven and is always looking for what she can do, or learn to advance her skills.  She nurtures her network and likes to meet new people. She is also passionate about diversity, equity, and inclusion both in and outside of work.  It is my belief that the combination of what I’ve described, as well as other strengths I didn’t highlight that she would be an asset to a team, and has a long career ahead of her.",

We have worked together for a little over a year at Liberty Mutual, working on modernizing an internal web application.  Right from the start, Maria was a driving force towards incorporating new and emerging technology into our product; looking for ways to make it work faster and more intuitively for our customers, and to make our experience in the actual code writing cleaner and simpler.  Her drive to learn and engage new technologies, as well as her careful consideration of design and operation, would make her invaluable to any engineering team, but especially one looking to leverage the most modern tools available.",

      "description": "Maria strives to make things better and thrives in an environment that fosters learning and innovation. She's not afraid to reach out and make new connections to solve problems together.  Recently, she organized an adhoc group of engineers from across our enterprise IT group to create reusable software patterns when none existed.  The patterns help engineers create a new NextJS webapp with security, testing, and CI/CD pipelines out of the box.  Her patterns have already been reused multiple times and saved hundreds of engineer hours.  She's also very good at asking the right questions to make sure everyone understands the problem before attempting to solve it.  She is not happy with a subpar product and pushes for doing things the right way.  She has strong self-study habits and teaches others what she learns.  I've known Maria for 3 years and have thoroughly enjoyed my time working with her.",

      "description": "Maria and I had the pleasure of working together whilst at Liberty Mutual. In our forums, she was asking some thought-provoking and advanced questions that sparked our collaboration. From the start, Maria struck me as a go-getter, extremely drive, and ready to tackle any problem. Quickly, I realized she was not your average hard worker, but also extremely passionate about the craft and willing to take risks to do what was ultimately right for the company.  Through this, she was able to deliver a cutting-edge, reusable pattern not just for herself, but the entire enterprise that will continue to be used for years to come, thus accelerating our development efforts. This mentality proves a greater understanding of an enterprise and collaboration across organizations that often goes under-represented and creates duplication/wasted effort for organizations.  Later in our collaboration, Maria brought another peer into the mix; someone who was sharing the same glow around the craft as she was. It was evident that her energy and ability to rally others to a cause was contagious; displaying her ability to lead a team, not just be an individual contributor.  I firmly believe Maria would be the best investment an organization could make when hiring an employee as she will accel in any scenario, do what is right even when its hard, and continue to grow others around her to be the best that they can be; her leadership and technical skillsets are industry-leading.",

In each of three projects she researched and implemented services, APIs, plugins, and technologies that were not part of the curriculum, and that no other student groups reached for. In her projects she implemented custom animations, built web-based games, and constantly pushed herself to learn everything she possibly could. She was undaunted at learning several Amazon Web Services such as Polly, Cognito, and Amplify during her final project.  Beyond technical ability, Maria was always the first person to speak with, and support, every other student. She attended every event she could, spoke with many industry professionals, and provided a ton of resources to the other students to help them with their own professional development. She is a wonderful student, person, and would make a great addition to any team looking to push some boundaries.",

She was brave enough to express openly what she didn't know allowing others who could not, to gain insight about their learning gaps. She is motivated, intelligent and mission driven as we saw through the high level creativity and success of her various projects. Maria is a people person who knows how to break the ice and bring the group together. Any company that brings her onboard is a company that will be better for it.",
