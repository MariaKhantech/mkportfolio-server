She was able to find creative ways to integrate newer technologies into her work and the application was better for it! She’s also incredible at fostering community in her fellow teammates, which brought more fruitful conversations when designing applications. Always willing to share what she finds while researching topics, she’s a great collaborator when venturing into the unknown.",

      "description": "I worked with Maria for a little over a year and during that time, I was impressed not only by Maria's technical coding abilities but also her eagerness to learn. At the time, she had just completed the TechStart program within Liberty Mutual, and I interviewed her to join my team. Not only was her technical ability superb, but she was able to communicate her thoughts effectively. After that process was complete, she joined my team as an Associate Software Engineer. As a new member of the team and also as a relatively new software engineer in her career, she had a lot of questions. This led into me mentoring her during her first couple months. She is very patient, curious, and has very high standards for the work that she does. For example, while she was learning, she always wanted to understand concepts and ideas fully, and asked lots of questions and she cared deeply about her work and wanted her work to be as high quality as possible, which I really appreciated. Even though it took her a bit longer to complete her work, she always did her work diligently and with very high quality, and as a result very few bugs came out of the features that she built. She is also a very warm hearted person. She took the initiative to organize virtual hangouts with the other engineers to bond, and we all learned something about each other in those hangouts and they were a lot of fun. Overall, Maria is a very talented, curious, and diligent engineer who is also a trustworthy team player and friend. I think any team would be lucky to have her and her future looks very bright.",

Recently, she organized an adhoc group of engineers from across our enterprise IT group to create reusable software patterns when none existed.  The patterns help engineers create a new NextJS webapp with security, testing, and CI/CD pipelines out of the box.  Her patterns have already been reused multiple times and saved hundreds of engineer hours.  She's also very good at asking the right questions to make sure everyone understands the problem before attempting to solve it.  She is not happy with a subpar product and pushes for doing things the right way.  She has strong self-study habits and teaches others what she learns.

In our forums, she was asking some thought-provoking and advanced questions that sparked our collaboration.

Quickly, I realized she was not your average hard worker, but also extremely passionate about the craft and willing to take risks to do what was ultimately right for the company.<span class=\"white-space-pre\"> </span><br><br>Through this, she was able to deliver a cutting-edge, reusable pattern not just for herself, but the entire enterprise that will continue to be used for years to come, thus accelerating our development efforts. This mentality proves a greater understanding of an enterprise and collaboration across organizations that often goes under-represented and creates duplication/wasted effort for organizations.<br><br>Later in our collaboration, Maria brought another peer into the mix; someone who was sharing the same glow around the craft as she was. It was evident that her energy and ability to rally others to a cause was contagious; displaying her ability to lead a team, not just be an individual contributor.<br><br>I firmly believe Maria would be the best investment an organization could make when hiring an employee as she will accel in any scenario, do what is right even when its hard, and continue to grow others around her to be the best that they can be; her leadership and technical skillsets are industry-leading.",

In each of three projects she researched and implemented services, APIs, plugins, and technologies that were not part of the curriculum, and that no other student groups reached for. In her projects she implemented custom animations, built web-based games, and constantly pushed herself to learn everything she possibly could. She was undaunted at learning several Amazon Web Services such as Polly, Cognito, and Amplify during her final project.<br><br>Beyond technical ability, Maria was always the first person to speak with, and support, every other student. She attended every event she could, spoke with many industry professionals, and provided a ton of resources to the other students to help them with their own professional development. She is a wonderful student, person, and would make a great addition to any team looking to push some boundaries.",

Working together, she has shown herself to be thoughtful about the needs of others, often volunteering her time and energy in ensuring that everyone in the class didn't feel neglected or fell through the cracks. She was brave enough to express openly what she didn't know allowing others who could not, to gain insight about their learning gaps. She is motivated, intelligent and mission driven as we saw through the high level creativity and success of her various projects. Maria is a people person who knows how to break the ice and bring the group together. Any company that brings her onboard is a company that will be better for it.",
